## Lessons Learned

In this project I learned several ways to control CSS positioning, how positioning affects descendant elements and their stacking by layers, how to use gradients to build a rich design, how to make interesting animations and how to provide an adaptive design using CSS Grid and media queries.

In addition, I learned how to use new libraries to run tasks in parallel within the shell, and to run them using npm scripts.
